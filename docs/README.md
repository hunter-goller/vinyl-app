# Vinyl App Documentation

This directory is the documentation source for Vinyl App. It is written in
Markdown so it can be reviewed with code today and published through GitHub
Pages later.

## Start here

- [Current implementation status](implementation-status.md)
- [Architecture overview](architecture/overview.md)
- [Project structure](architecture/project-structure.md)
- [Development setup](development/setup.md)
- [Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md)
- [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md)

## Architecture

| Document | Question answered |
| --- | --- |
| [Overview](architecture/overview.md) | How is the application organized now, and what is the target flow? |
| [Project structure](architecture/project-structure.md) | What belongs in each folder? |
| [Dependency graph](architecture/dependency-graph.md) | Which layers and tickets unblock Collection? |
| [Routing](architecture/routing.md) | How are routes declared and resolved? |
| [State management](architecture/state-management.md) | Which Riverpod providers exist and which are planned? |
| [Database](architecture/database.md) | How is local data stored and tested? |
| [Repository pattern](architecture/repository-pattern.md) | What will separate Drift from feature code? |
| [Services](architecture/services.md) | Where will multi-step business logic live? |
| [CI/CD](architecture/ci-cd.md) | What does GitHub Actions verify? |

## Development

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Setup](development/setup.md) | Install dependencies and run the app |
| [Code generation](development/code-generation.md) | Regenerate Riverpod and Drift code |
| [Coding standards](development/coding-standards.md) | Follow project conventions |
| [Git workflow](development/git-workflow.md) | Create branches and merge work |
| [Pull requests](development/pull-requests.md) | Prepare reviewable changes |
| [Testing](development/testing.md) | Understand current and planned tests |
| [Documentation maintenance](development/documentation-maintenance.md) | Keep docs synchronized with `main` |
| [Release process](development/release-process.md) | Prepare future versioned releases |

## Architecture decisions

The [ADR index](decisions/README.md) records durable technical decisions:

- Flutter application framework
- Riverpod for state and dependency management
- Drift and SQLite for local persistence
- GoRouter for navigation
- Feature-oriented presentation with shared application layers
- Direct native Drift connection setup

## Feature specifications

The [feature index](features/README.md) separates current implementation from
target product behavior.

## Documentation baseline

These documents reflect `main` after VinylApp-009 and VinylApp-010 were merged:

- VinylApp-001 through 007 are complete.
- VinylApp-008 is deferred.
- VinylApp-009 and 010 are complete.
- VinylApp-011 is next.
- Repositories and services are not implemented.
- Only `routerProvider` and `databaseProvider` currently exist.
- All user-facing feature screens are placeholders.
- VinylApp-018 is an unmerged fake-data prototype and is on hold.

When code and documentation disagree, `main` is the source of truth. A branch,
ZIP, mockup, or prototype must be labeled as such until its pull request is
merged.
